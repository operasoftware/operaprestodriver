OperaDriver
===========

OperaDriver is a vendor-supported WebDriver implementation developed by [Opera
Software](http://opera.com/) and volunteers that implements [WebDriver's wire
protocol](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/index.html).

OperaDriver can drive the browser running various tests on your web pages, just
as if a real user was navigating through them.  It can simulate actions like
clicking links, entering text and submitting forms, and reports results back to
you so you know that your website works as intended.

OperaDriver's end-user emulation ensures that your entire stack (HTML, scripts,
styling, embedded resources and backend setup) is functioning correctly, and
this without tedious manual testing routines.


Requirements
------------

You will need Oracle's Java Runtime Environment 1.5 or newer to use
OperaDriver.  It uses the [Scope
interface](http://dragonfly.opera.com/app/scope-interface/) (same as for
[Dragonfly](http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/)) to communicate directly with
Opera from Java.  Consequently, it is only compatible with Opera version 11.5
or newer.

The OperaDriver server expects you to have Opera installed in the default
location for each system:

| __OS__    | __Expected Location of Opera__               |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| GNU/Linux | /usr/bin/opera                               |
| Mac       | /Applications/Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/Opera |
| WIndows   | \%PROGRAMFILES%\Opera\opera.exe              |

However, you can override this and specify a custom location to Opera by
setting the capability `opera.path` or environmnetal variable `OPERA_PATH`.
You can read more about configuring WebDriver under Advanced Usage.

Other libraries required by OperaDriver:

  * Apache Commons Exec 1.1
  * Apache Commons JXPath 1.3
  * Google Guava 10.0.1
  * Google protobuf 2.4.1
  * ini4j 0.5.2
  * json-20080701.jar
  * JUnit 4.10
  * Selenium 2.15.0

### OperaDriver on 11.52 or older

To use OperaDriver on Opera < 11.52, make sure you set the capabilities
`opera.port` to `-1` and `opera.profile` to `""` (empty string) to
disable `-debugproxy` and `-pd` command-line arguments which older
versions of Opera do not support.


Getting started
---------------

### Remotely

To get set up [please
download](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list) either
*selenium-server-standalone* or *selenium-server* and make sure you have a
fairly recent version of Opera installed.  All you do is to create a new
`OperaDriver` instance:

    WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();
    driver.navigate().to("http://opera.com/");


### Running the server as a standalone process

Since OperaDriver implements the wire protocol, it is fully compatibly with any
[RemoteWebDriver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriver)
client.  Simply start up your server, create a client, and away you go:

    WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver("http://localhost:9515", DesiredCapabilities.opera());
    driver.navigate().to("http://opera.com/");


### Separate OperaDriver

You can also use OperaDriver as a standalone dependency in your project.
Download the package from the [Github project's download
section](https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/downloads) and extract it
to a location of your choice.  To see some examples look at the
[examples/](https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/tree/master/examples)
directory.  For your own projects include the lib/* directory on your
classpath, for example:

    javac -classpath "lib/*:." Example.java

In Eclipse this can be done under _Project_ → _Properties_ → _Java Build Path_
and then *"Add JARs..."* or *"Add External JARs..."* depending on the layout of
your project.


Advanced Usage
--------------

### Capabilities

You can use the
[DesiredCapabilities](http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/DesiredCapabilities.html)
class to specify settings for OperaDriver.  The capabilities we support are:

| __Capability__              | __Type__ | __Default__ | __Description__             |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| __opera.logging.level__     | String   | "INFO"      | How verbose the logging should be.  Available levels are: SEVERE (highest value), WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST (lowest value), ALL.  Default is INFO.
| __opera.logging.file__      | String   | null        | Where to send the output of the logging.  Default is to not write to file.
| __opera.binary__            | String   | null        | Path to the Opera binary to use.  If not specified, OperaDriver will guess the path to your Opera installation.
| __opera.arguments__         | String   | null        | Arguments to pass on to Opera, separated by spaces.  See `opera -help` for available command-line arguments.
| __opera.host__              | String   | "127.0.0.1" | The host Opera should connect to.  Unless you're starting Opera manually you won't need this.
| __opera.port__              | Integer  | 7001        | The port Opera should connect to.  0 = Random port, -1 = Opera default (port 7001) (for use with Opera < 12).
| __opera.launcher__          | String   | null        | Absolute path to the launcher binary to use.  The launcher is a gateway between OperaDriver and the Opera browser, and is being used for controlling and monitoring the binary, and taking external screenshots.  If left blank, OperaDriver will use the launcher supplied with the package.
| __opera.profile__           | String   | null        | Directory to use for the Opera profile.  If null a random temporary directory is used.  If "", an empty string, then the default autotest profile directory is used.
| __opera.idle__              | Boolean  | false       | Whether to use Opera's alternative implicit wait implementation.  It will use an in-browser heuristic to guess when a page has finished loading,allowing us to determine with great accuracy whether there are any planned events in the document.  This functionality is useful for very simple test cases, but not designed for real-world testing.  It is disabled by default.
| __opera.display__           | Integer  | null        | The X display to use.  (Only works on UNIX-like OSes.)
| __opera.autostart__         | Boolean  | true        | Whether to auto-start the Opera binary.  If false, OperaDriver will wait for a connection from the browser.  Go to "opera:debug", enter the correct port number and hit "Connect" to connect manually.
| __opera.no_restart__        | Boolean  | false       | Whether to restart.
| __opera.no_quit__           | Boolean  | false       | Whether to quit Opera when OperaDriver is shut down.  If enabled, it will keep the browser running after the driver is shut down.
| __opera.guess_binary_path__ | Boolean  | true        | Whether to guess the path to Opera if it isn't set in `opera.binary`.
| __opera.product__           | String   | null        | The product we are using, for example "desktop" or "core-desktop", "sdk".  See [OperaProduct](https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/blob/master/src/com/opera/core/systems/OperaProduct.java) for all available values.

To use capabilities:

    DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.opera();
    capabilities.setCapability("opera.logging.level", "CONFIG");
    capabilities.setCapability("opera.logging.file", "/var/log/operadriver.log");
    capabilities.setCapability("opera.display", 8);
    capabilities.setCapability("opera.profile", "/home/andreastt/my-own-opera-profile");

    // Now use it
    WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver(capabilities);
    driver.navigate().to("http://opera.com/");

### Environment variables

To specify such things as a custom location of the Opera binary and the
command-line arguments to use, you may use environmental variables also.  This
is a list of the environmental variables which can be set on any operating
system:

| __Name__          | __Description__                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __OPERA_PATH__    | The absolute path to the Opera binary you want to use.  If not set OperaDriver will try to locate Opera on your system.                                                                                                      |
| __OPERA_ARGS__    | A space-delimited list of arguments to pass on to Opera, e.g. `-nowindow`, `-dimensions 1600x1200`, &c.  See `opera --help` to view available arguments.                                                                     |
| __OPERA_PRODUCT__ | To override the product check when running the OperaDriver tests.  Set this to any value specified in [OperaProduct](https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver/blob/master/src/com/opera/core/systems/OperaProduct.java). |

To set environment variables:

  * __Linux and Mac__: `export OPERA_PATH=...`, and add this line to `~/.bashrc` (or your shell's configuration file) to use in all future sessions.
  * __Windows__: Please follow this guide: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519

| 11.60       |                                                                                                                             |
| 11.52       | Set `opera.port` to `-1` and `opera.profile` to "" (empty string) to disable `-debugproxy` and `-pd` command-line arguments |
| 11.51       |                                                                                                                             |
| 11.50       |                                                                                                                             |
| 11.11       |                                                                                                                             |
| 11.10       |                                                                                                                             |
| 11.01       | `-autotestmode` command-line argument is not supported, use a wrapper script                                                |
| 11.00       |                                                                                                                             |


#### Wrapper script

Some Opera versions don't support the `-autotestmode`, `-debugproxy` or `-pd`
arguments sent by OperaDriver by default.  You can bypass this problem by
creating a wrapper script like this and pointing the capability `opera.binary`
to its absolute path:

    #!/bin/sh
    # Wrapper to prevent the -autotestmode argument reaching this version of Opera
    # which doesn't support it.
    `dirname $0`/opera
