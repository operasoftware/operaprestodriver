============================

API changes
-----------

 * Update Selenium jar to 2.6.0. (Ajay Kemparaj)
 * Update the protobuf library from 2.3.0 to 2.4.1 and regenerating all
   Proto files. (stuartk)

   instead of attempting to recover by guessing Opera's path. (andreastt)

------------

 * Add support for OperaDriver.switchTo().frame(WebElement). (stuartk)

Bug fixes
---------

 * Fix bug preventing switching to frames beneath the current one. (stuartk)

Tests
-----

Other
-----

 * Major refactoring of OperaPaths. (andreastt)
 * Better exception if failing to start the launcher on Windows, explaining
   Visual C++ dependency. (andreastt)

2011/09/08 OperaDriver 0.7.2
============================

API changes
-----------

 * DefaultDriverFactory in Selenium expects a Capabilities type constructor
   argument rather than DesiredCapabilities.  OperaDriver now uses Capabilities
   instead to match the other WebDriver implementations.  This fixes various
   problems related to remote driving.  (andreastt)

 * The capability "opera.binary_profile" has been renamed to "opera.product".
   (andreastt)

Bug fixes
---------

 * -autotestmode, -debugproxy and -pd arguments are now sent to Opera before
   unwrapping the arbitrary list of arguments sent by user.  (andreastt)
 * Sanitizing capabilities sent across the wire, as Ruby will sent us Long's
   for Integer's which are not easily converted in Java.  (andreastt)

Tests
-----

 * Correct checking for Windows platform in tests.  (stuartk)
 * Updated various tests.  (andreastt)

Other
-----

   .getCoreVersion(), .getUserAgent() and .getPID() and replace with
   OperaDriver.utils().*  (andreastt)

Bug fixes
---------

 * Make OperaWebElement.sendKeys enter text at the end when an input has
   default text. (stuartk)
 * Clear Should only clear editable and enabled elements. (ajayk)

   (stuartk)

Other

   "opera.arguments" amongst others. See the top of the OperaDriver class

   capability. Currently only available on Linux Opera builds.

   driver on. Allows multiple instances of Opera to be run at once. Requires
   the `-debugproxy` flag, which is not yet available in current versions
   of Opera. (stuartk)
 * Add capability to set the logging level and file with "opera.logging.level"
   and "opera.logging.file". (andreastt)
 * Updated Linux launcher to support the `-profile` argument, to specify
   which build profile we are using (Note: this ISN'T the Opera user profile).
   (Iaroslav Tymchenko)
 * Display the command used to start Opera when it exits immediately (usually
