 * Discussion
 * ----------
 *
 * This protocol will prevent a lot of flooding from the other services, but it will on the other hand flood a bit itself.
 * There is no way to stop it from sending `OnWindowActivated` messages for example.
 *
 * When Opera Dragonfly is used to debug on the desktop, it probably doesn't want to use this service at all, but just have
 * the filters automatically set to include the active window. We might cater for this later. The way to do it with the current
 * protocol would be to retrieve the active window and put that in the include filter manually. However the active window might
 * have changed by the time Opera Dragonfly gets to do that. Additionally, we would like Opera Dragonfly to start with a certain
 * DOM node selected. I see no other way than adding some C++ hooks to do this when debugging locally.
