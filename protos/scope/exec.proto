/**
 * The Opera Exec protocol can be used to control an Opera instance from
 * the outside, and various operations can be initiated. This
 * functionality is mainly useful for QA testing.
 *
 * Examples
 * --------
 *
 * The following example will do a spatial navigation down:
 *
 * .. code-block:: javascript
 *
 *   Exec([
 *         [
 *          ["_keydown","shift"],
 *          ["_keydown","down"],
 *          ["_keyup","down"],
 *          ["_keyup","shift"]
 *         ]
 *        ])
 *
 * The following will type the text "Hello":
 *
 * .. code-block:: javascript
 *
 *   Exec([
 *         [
 *          ["_type","Hello"]
 *         ]
 *        ])
 *
 * Take note that shift-modifier key-presses are neither generated
 * nor taken into account when processing the letters of the ``_type``
 * operation. This means that no shift key will be pressed around the `"H"`
 * in `"Hello"` above, and the text typed would still be `"Hello"` if the
 * shift key was pressed (with a ``_keydown`` operation) before the ``_type``
 * operation.
 *
 * The following will trigger an Action of "Page down":
 *
 * .. code-block:: javascript
 *
 *   Exec([
 *         [
 *          ["Page Down"]
 *         ]
 *        ])
 *
 * Error handling
 * --------------
 *
 * There are currently no error messages or other reports of a failed
 * operation.  Incorrect syntax, unknown keys, or other invalid input will
 * be silently dropped.
