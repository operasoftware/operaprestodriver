Scope protocols for Java
========================

This directory contains various protocol definition files used in
OperaDriver's Scope implementation for Java.

The .proto files located in /protos/scope are the original Scope service
files used in Opera.  They have a protobufesque syntax but are infact
Scope protocols, and can therefore not be used for compiling Java
classes directly using protoc.

The .proto files located in /protos (this directory) are transformed
Google Protobuffer-compatible files.  These can be compiled into Java
classes using protoc:

    protoc --java_out=../src *.proto

You must use protoc version >= 2.4.1.

The core Scope services .proto files in /protos/scope are from
<URI:https://bitbucket.org/scope/scope-services>.  The desktop proto
files (desktop_utils.proto, desktop_window_manager.proto and
system_input.proto) are new here.

These original file can be transformed into Google Protobuffer .proto
files by using a tool called hob, which is a multi-language code
generator for the Opera Scope protocol:

  <URI:https://bitbucket.org/scope/hob/>

OperaDriver provides an extension to hob called javagen (located in
/protos/scope/javagen) that makes it possible to compile the transformed
.proto files into Java classes using protoc.  Essentially it makes a few
modifications to the package options of each file and removes one
Scope-related “service { … }” section.

You can customize the package options for each service (which is
correlated to a .proto file) by editing the file
/protos/scope/java.conf.

To install hob:

    easy_install hob

To generate Google Protobuffer-compatible .proto files from the Scope
protocols:

    cd scope
    mkdir out
    hob -c hob.conf java --out=../

Then to compile the files:

    cd ..
    protoc --java_out=../src *.proto
