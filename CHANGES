v0.16     (2012-08-02)

  [API CHANGES]

  * Introduced OperaMobileDriver class, exposing the following
    additional APIs (inherits from OperaDriver):

      - void rotate(ScreenOrientation orientation)
      - ScreenOrientation getOrientation()
      - TouchScreen getTouch()

  * Several Opera specific features are now declared in role-based
    interfaces, and the different products in OperaDriver implements
    different sets of these interfaces.  This should help future
    compatibility with the Selenium remote driver.  (andreastt)

  * OperaProduct#toString() will now return an actual string
    representation of the product, and not the identifier string.  To
    get the identifier, please use
    OperaProduct#getDescriptionString().

  * OperaDriver#proxy() returns OperaProxy, which can be used to
    manipulate the proxy configuration during runtime.  But please
    prefer using org.openqa.selenium.Proxy as a capability instead.
    (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Support for Opera Mobile:

    - Partial support for TouchScreen.  down(), up(), move(), scroll()
      and flick() will currently throw UnsupportedOperationExceptions.

    - Partial support for Rotatable.
      OperaMobileDriver#rotate(orientation) will throw
      UnsupportedOperationException.

    (andreastt)

  * Support for Selenium's Proxy configuration.  (mexicano, andreastt)

  * Using precalculated MD5 sums for launchers.  (danielb)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix OPERA_ARGS not being parsed always.  (andreastt)

  * Fix OperaDriver#quit() to not hide any recursive exceptions,
    especially dealing with garbage collection.

    OperaDriver 0.15 may have left Opera instances running on the
    system, and this patch should address that problem by more
    reliably dealing with exceptions during shutdown.

    (virgild, andreastt)

  * Fix some cases of double-wrapped WebDriverExceptions.  (andreastt)

  * Checks for connection and null pointers in OperaDriver#gc().
    (virgild)

  [TESTS]

  * Adapt test framework to support OperaMobileDriver.  (andreastt)

  * Run configuration for FindElementsTest.  (andreastt)

  * Fix OperaFilePreferencesTest for Mobile and cache
    product/platform.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Updated the WebDriver atoms.  (andreastt)

  * Fix static analysis exclusions.  (danielb)

  * Updated Guava to 12.0.1.  (andreastt)

  * Updated window-manager Scope protocol to version 2.3.  (andreastt)

  * OPDRV-188: Selftest API refactor.

    OperaDriver#selftest() no longer accepts a list of modules.  It
    now accepts exactly one module instead.  (andreastt)

  * Some selftests can take up to 200s to finish, increased the
    overall selftest timeout to 200 s.  (andreastt)

  * Null pointer fix in EcmascriptService#setRuntime().  (danielb,
    virgild)

  * Opera SDK builds identify themselves as "devices", not "sdk".
    (andreastt)

  * Cleaned up retry and sleeps when failing to evaluate ECMAscript.

v0.14     (2012-05-29)

  [API CHANGES]

  * Added OperaMouse#tripleClick() and #quadrupleClick() which are
    recognized by Opera.  (andreastt)

  * OperaUtils#getOS() renamed to #getPlatform(), and now returns type
    Platform.  (andreastt)

  * Introduced ScopeServices#isConnected() to check for a connection
    to Opera.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * OPDRV-121: Implemented window-manager's CreateWindow command.
    (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * OPDRV-179: Upgraded exec service to 2.2.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded window-manager service to 2.2.  (andreastt)

  * OPDRV-127: Retreiving multi-click interval from awt.
    (mzajaczkowski)

  * Implemented Closeables.  (andreastt)

  * Abstracted hardcoded timeout for launcher response timeout to
    OperaIntervals.  (andreastt)

  * Window closing code now respects that core-gogi and Desktop on
    Windows has different concepts of what a window is.  We cache the
    number of open windows before WebDriver#close() call because they
    will auto-open new windows when the last one is closed.  If the
    user tries to close the last window, we will quit the browser
    according to the WebDriver spec.  (andreastt)

  * Cleaned up driver quit code: Opera is first closed, runner forces
    an Opera shutdown, shuts down itself, then services are shut down.
    Finally the profile and log files are cleaned up (after browser is
    shut down), and then a garbage collection occurs.  The `runner'
    field is not nulled because the user might want to query whether
    browser is running or not.  (andreastt)

  * No longer wrapping exceptions from Scope in WebDriverException's
    as this obfuscates the real intent and since WebDriverException is
    a final exception it will print twice since we catch it in
    OperaDriver#init().  (andreastt)

  * Generalized the sleep time between a window close in
    OperaIntervals#WINDOW_CLOSE_SLEEP.  (andreastt)

  * Implemented OperaSettings#equals().

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Made default product DESKTOP, fixes issue with reusing old
    profiles.  (andreastt)

  * OperaDriver#getWindowHandles() will return an empty set if we are
    no longer connected to Opera.  (andreastt)

  * Fix OperaProfile to work with RemoteWebDriver.  (dawagner)

  * Close the socket output stream on
    OperaLauncherProtocol#shutdown().  (danielb)

  * Close the selector in SocketMonitor when done, otherwise we will
    leak file descriptors.  (danielb)

  * Close ServerSocket if an exception is thrown.  (danielb)

  * OPDRV-125: Avoid sending double shutdown commands to launcher.
    (mzajaczkowski)

  * Logging file name and the actual IO issue when something goes bad
    in OperaFilePreferences.  (andreastt)

  * Using an immutable list to define services.  (andreastt)

  * Propagating exception from OperaDriver#createScopeServices() since
    we already catch everything and throw to WebDriverException in
    OperaDriver#init().  (andreastt)

  * Catching IOException explicitly in
    OperaWebElement#saveScreenshot().  (andreastt)

  * Not printing stack traces from SocketMonitor#stop() to stdout any
    more.  (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherProtocol now uses an immutable map as a reverse
    lookup.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Replaced old window management code with CreateWindow from Scope.
    (andreastt)

  * Converted the HTTP redirect test to a local test.  (andreastt)

  * OPDRV-121: Added tests for resetting windows on a running browser.
    Used in SpartanRunner.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored test framework to support probing of correct product.
    (andreastt)

  * Moved from Jetty to Webbit to match the Selenium project.
    (andreastt)

  * Misc. cleanup in WindowManager.  (andreastt)

  * TestOperaDriver#isRunning() makes call to
    ScopeServices#isConnected() if runner is not present rather than
    relying on a local boolean value.  (andreastt)

  * Removed unused method TestOperaDriver.getDefaultCapabilities().
    (andreastt)

  * Make sure runner is always shut down in OperaLauncherRunnerTest.
    Fixes a test on GNU/Linux.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Officially targetting Java 6/JDK 1.6.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded the WebDriver atoms.  (andreastt)


v0.13     (2012-05-08)

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed OperaDriver.getVersion().  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix for overwriting outdated launchers.  (andreastt)

  * The default product in OperaSettings is now OperaProduct.ALL, so
    that the command-line argument `-profile' is not appeneded every
    time to the launcher.  (andreastt)

  * OperaUtils.getPID() might return null, so changing return type
    from primitive int to Integer.  (andreastt)

  * Reverted patch to fixing useless control flows in
    EcmaScriptDebugger since it caused issues for the
    FrameSwitchingTest in Selenium.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Tests for checking `-profile' command-line argument in
    OperaLauncherRunnerTest.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Upgraded operalaunchers to 0.8.  (andreastt)

  * Added Sonar build target.  (danielb)


v0.12     (2012-05-04)

    (andreastt)

  * Removed deprecated methods OperaDriver.click(x,y) and
    click(times).  (andreastt)

  * Deprecated method OperaDriver.getOperaActionList().  (andreastt)

  * Deprecated method OperaWebElement.containsColor().  (andreastt)

  * Deprecated capability opera.no_restart.  (andreastt)

  * Deprecated capability opera.no_quit, replaced by new capability
    opera.detach.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added OperaSettings for managing options to OperaDriver
    internally.  While this can be used for OperaDriver's constructor,
    it's highly recommended to use Capabilities instead.  (andreastt)

  * Added ready-transformed Google Protobuf compatible protocols in
    /protos.  Original Scope protocols have been moved to
    /protos/scope.  See /protos/README for detailed instructions on
    compilation.  (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Added default path lookup for Opera Mobile for Unix, Mac and
    Windows.  (andreastt)

  * Raised handshake timeout to 60 seconds.  (andreastt)

  * By default we are now allowing popups to be opened when using
    Opera through OperaDriver.

    This can be disabled by doing:

        preferences().set("User Prefs", "Ignore Unrequested Popups",
                          true);

    (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Preserving mouse and keyboard state.

    When running OperaDriver through a remote server stateless calls
    are made through the JSON wire protocol.  When performing an
    Actions chain like this:

        new Actions(driver).sendKeys(element, "foo").perform();

    … we need to make sure to preserve the mouse move coordinates for
    the next click() call.

    (andreastt)

  * Enabling clicking of disabled elements by default.  Removed
    jar_internal build target.  (andreastt)

  * Workaround for letting Opera Mobile autofocus form elements
    through ECMAScript.  (andreastt)

  * Environment variable OPERA_LAUNCHER did not get recognized
    properly.  Cleaned up some dubious code paths in
    OperaLauncherRunnerSettings.  (andreastt)

  * Made call to java.io.File.canExecute() in OperaLauncherRunner Java
    1.5 safe.  (andreastt)

  * Added class OperaBoolean containing utility methosd for doing C to
    JVM conversions.  (andreastt)

  * Implemented OperaArguments.toJson() for bean-to-JSON conversion.
    (andreastt)

  * Now using CommandLine from Selenium to launch Opera if using the
    Java-based OperaRunner.  (andreastt)

  * Using OperaIntervals.RESPONSE_TIMEOUT for connection monitoring in
    StpThread instead of a hardcoded 60 second value.  (andreastt)

  * Using correct interval for script retrying consistenly.  Removed
    OperaIntervals.SCRIPT_RETRY, replaced by SCRIPT_RETRY_INTERVAL.
    (andreastt)

  * Switched on logging for SocketMonitor.  (andreastt)

  * Removed PbActionHandler, and replaced by making calls directly to
    OperaMouse.  (andreastt)

  * Check for null in OperaArguments.merge().  (andreastt)

  * Fixed infinite recursive loop in OperaDesktopDriver.isOperaRunning().
    (andreastt)

  * Fixed dead store field in OperaStrings.  (andreastt)

  * In ScreenShotReply user-supplied byte array was stored directly, now
    cloning it.  (andreastt)

  * List array to string array conversion with size boundaries in
    OperaRunner.  (andreastt)

  * Correct lock release in OperaRunner under all exception
    conditions.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed dead store field in OperaLauncherProtocol.  (andreastt)

  * SelfTestResult.hashCode() implemented to match equals().  (andreastt)

  * Ensuring unlock on all exception paths in SocketMonitor.
    (andreastt)

  * All threads are now being notified in WaitState.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed many statical analysis bugs in DesktopWindowManager.
    (andreastt)

  * Preserving stack traces and forcing UTF-8 in ScopeServices.
    (andreastt)

  * OperaArguments.merge() made final because it's used from
    constructor.  (andreastt)

  * Removed unused method OperaDriverBuilder.getDefaultSettings().
    (andreastt)

  * Using implied modifiers in many interfaces.  (andreastt)

  * Reusing OperaIntervals.PROCESS_START_SLEEP in OperaLauncherRunner.
    (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Mimicking Selenium test setup to more easily allow for test
    sharing.  (andreastt)

  * Added FreshDriver, NoDriverAfterTest, NoDriver, RequireService and
    Settings annotations to improve test setup.  (andreastt)

  * Added MockOperaDriver to allow testing of configuration parsing in
    OperaSettingsTest.  (andreastt)

  * Enabled test web server to use a non-loopback address for testing
    so that remote Operas can connect.  (andreastt)

  * Generalized environmental variables management to be included in
    the generic test setup.  (andreastt)

  * Made it possible to also unset environmental variables during
    runtime.  (andreastt)

  * Replaced TestOperaDriver.getDefaultCapabilities() with
    TestOperaDriverSupplier instead.  (andreastt)

  * If testing on a remote device, we might not be using a local
    OperaRunner.  Added check for this.  (andreastt)

  * Removed getFixture() and related methods.  Now relying completely
    upon WebServer and Pages.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Upgraded to Selenium 2.21.0.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded to Guava 12.0.  (dawagner)

  * Upgraded launchers to 0.7, now with support for taking external

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * New interface OperaProfile for interacting with the profile for
    Opera.  You can for example modify or set new preferences on

                                 "Ignore Unrequested Popups", false);
       WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver(profile);

    You can also interact with existing profiles by passing in the
    directory to OperaProfile's constructor.

    (andreastt)

  * New interface OperaPreferences for managing preferences in
    preference files (like operaprefs.ini) and during runtime through
    Scope.

    Calls to preference may be done like this:

       driver.preferences().set("User Prefs",
                                "Ignore Unrequested Popups", false);

    OperaScopePreferences replaces OperaDriver.getPref() and
    OperaDriver.setPref() which are now deprecated.

    (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Reduced much code duplication.  (andreastt)

  * Default product for OperaRunnerSettings is now DESKTOP.
    (andreastt)

  * Upgraded WebDriver atoms.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded OperaWebElement.click() to use new atoms for selecting an
    OPTION element.  (andreastt)

  * Check for whether launcher exists immediately.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded operalaunchers to 0.5.  Fixes issue with OperaDriver
    through Maven not being able to find launchers.  (andreastt)


  [BUG FIXES]

  * Asserting if element is stale on OperaWebElement.getText(),
    getLocation(), getTagName() and clear().  (andreastt)

  * If a page load times out we now return control of the browser _in
    all_ situations.  (andreastt)

  * Reverted check for setLastModified on newly copied launcher as it
    seems to be failing on Windows.  (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherRunner.isOperaRunning() no longer throws exception if
    launcher has shut down, but returns false instead.  (andreastt)

  * Object IDs are being garbage collected on each new page load, no
    need to store and verify URL when checking for stale elements.
    (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherBinary is now using Platform.is() (from Selenium) for
    platform comparison.  Will output nicer warning when failing on
    Windows without VS C++ 2008 redistributable package.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed issue with SocketException for double shutdown call in
    OperaLauncherRunnerProtocol, fixes tests for Windows.  (andreastt)

  * Getting colours with non-RGB values (such as "transparent") now
    works.  Resolves issue #49.  (andreastt)

  * OperaDriver.close() should quit browser if it closes the last
    window, resolves issue #48.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Added many new test run configurations for IntelliJ.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed NullPointerException in the case something went wrong during
    initialization of OperaDriver in OperaDriverTestCase.  (andreastt)

  * Added tests for OperaStrings.  (ajayk)

  * Tests for circumstances where StaleElementReferenceException
    should be thrown.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored many tests so that they pass on Windows, where JUnit
    test order is not guaranteed.  (andreastt)

  * Tests for handing back control to user after reaching
    PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Documented many methods.  (andreastt)

  * Updated Eclipse configuration.  (ajayk)

  * Updated IntelliJ configuration for version 11.  (andreastt)

  * Compile target “compile_tests” now requires “jar”.  (andreastt)

  * Added more examples to the README.  (andreastt)

  * Removed old interactions implementation in
    com.opera.core.systems.interaction since it was never used.
    (andreastt)


v0.8.1    2011-11-24

  [API CHANGES]

  * OperaDriver.get() and OperaNavigation().to() now catches
    ResponseNotReceivedException so that when a page load times out on
    very slow-loading pages, the control of the browser instance to the
    user.  (andreastt)

  * Added method pageLoadTimeout() to OperaTimeouts which allows you to
    control the default page load timeout, that is the timeout for when
    control of the browser should be handed back to the user.  Example:

      driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(40, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Output from Opera and the launcher is now forwarded to the
    appropriate logging level in OperaDriver.  (andreastt, danielb)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Upgraded Selenium dependency to 2.13.0.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded WebDriver atoms to match Selenium 2.13.0.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored heuristic for figuring out a sensible logging level
    between OperaDriver and launcher.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored OperaPaths.operaPath() to look for Opera Next binaries on
    all platforms.  Resolves OPDRV-104.  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Ensuring that the launcher is executable on each run.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed bug with synchronized locks ought to be on fields classified
    as final in WaitState.  (andreastt)

  * OperaArguments does not parse OPERA_ARGS, so calling
    OperaCoreArguments on startup instead.  Fixes bug with OPERA_ARGS
    not being parsed.  Addresses OPDRV-108.  (andreastt)

  * Parsing a single argument failed due to a bug in regex, corrected.
    Addresses OPDRV-108.  (andreastt)

  * Removed superflous call to isPathValid() in OperaPaths when checking
    whether a specified/set path is invalid.  (andreastt)

  * Arguments added in OperaCoreArgument's constructor were not merged
    if OperaRunner received an OperaRunnerSettings object with the
    arguments field set.  (andreastt)

  * Actions sent to OperaDriver.operaAction() are now converted to lower
    case in OperaExec.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Removed superflous code in OperaLauncherRunnerTest, and made
    assertions static.  (andreastt)

  * Added deprecated OperaDriverSettings tests to a separate file.
    (andreastt)

  * Added test for single argument parsing to OperaArgumentsTest.
    (andreastt)

  * Added new run configuration for OperaLauncherRunnerTest and
    OperaRunnerTest.  (andreastt)

  * Added tsts for OperaLauncherRunner.toLauncherLoggingLevel().
    (andreastt)

  * The "File Types Section Info" section does not exist on core-tv,
    using "Disk Cache" instead for PrefsTest, resolves about five
    failing tests on this configuration.  (andreastt)

  * Moved context menu test to be run last in ElementsTest because it's
    known to cause problems for consecutive tests.  (andreastt)

  * OperaRunnerTest now uses a mocking OperaRunner instance,
    TestOperaRunner, which exposes the settings field through a getter.
    (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Fixed classpath issues with previous release.  (ajayk)

  * Added Apache Commons Exec 1.1 as dependency as
    org.openqa.selenium.os.CommandLine now depends on it.  (andreastt)

  * Explanation for IllegalArgumentException for
    OperaExec.mouseAction(), helps WTR-362.  (andreastt)


v0.8    2011-11-17

  [API CHANGES]

  * OperaDriver now uses temporary profile and random port by default.
    This breaks backwards-compatibility with Opera < 11.60.  Please set
    capabilities opera.profile to "" (empty string) and opera.port to -1
    for it to not use a temporary profile and the default port (7001).
    (stuartk)

  * Updated Selenium dependency to 2.12.0.  (andreastt)

  * Throwing UnsupportedCommandException rather than a
    WebDriverException in OperaExec, so that it can be recovered.
    (andreastt)

  * Throwing UnsupportedOperationException for Options.ime().
    (andreastt)

  * Added Options.window() as a beta feature.  Currently not
    implemented, and will throw UnsupportedOperationException.
    (andreastt)

  * OperaRunnerSettings.setProduct() now accepts an OperaProduct, and
    not a String anymore.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * EcmascriptService is now used by default in OperaDriver, instead of
    EcmaScriptDebugger.  This means any injected JavaScript now
    potentially goes through JIT, enabling the JIT compiler inside the
    browser.  (stuartk)

  * Added "compile_protos" target to Ant build file for compiling proto
    files to Java classes.  (stuartk)

  * Added support for frame switching.  (stuartk)

  * Introducing OperaArguments (with accompanying OperaArgument,
    OperaCoreArgument and OperaDesktopArgument) which defines a joint
    interface for interacting with arguments to various kinds of Opera
    products.  (andreastt)

  * OperaProduct keeps a list of all Opera products.  (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Update EcmascriptService to be more similar to EcmaScriptDebugger.
    (stuartk)

  * Abstracted RuntimeNode from EcmaScriptDebugger into its own class so
    that it can be reused in EcmascriptService.  (stuartk)

  * Move methods common to EcmaScriptDebugger and EcmascriptService to a
    new class, AbstractEcmascriptService.

  * Replacing Apache Commons IO library calls with Guava (Simon Stewart,
    andreastt)

  * Upgraded from using OperaDriverSettings to using DesiredCapabilities
    in OperaDesktopDriver.  (andreastt)

  * The launchers have now been moved to a separate JAR,
    operalaunchers-*.jar, effectively removing the need to traverse the
    repo when running from source in SpartanRunner.  (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherRunner made separate from OperaRunner.  OperaRunner now
    implements a Java native way of launching Opera.  (andreastt)

  * Logging all ES implementations used to FINE rather than INFO.
    (andreastt)

  * Which Opera product is used is fetched after connecting and stored
    in the capability "opera.product".  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * OperaWebElement.getCssValue() now returns HEX values for
    colour-related variables.  (andreastt)

  * We were setting OperaIntervals#WAIT_FOR_ELEMENT to 0 every time when
    looking for an element, which overrode the implicit wait time
    specified through driver.manage().timeouts().  (andreastt)

  * Use the passed idle argument, not forcing idle to be true when
    calling setUseOperaIdle().  (danielb)

  * Since -pd is ignored by core builds, we must for some reason send
    -autotestmode last so that it doesn't consider the temporary profile
    to be the starting URL.  (andreastt)

  * Fix for making sure we create runtimes when we try to find them,
    instead of when we try to update the runtimes in EcmascriptService.
    (stuartk)

  * getWindowHandles() now gives names to windows without names.
    (stuartk)

  * Fix for NullPointerException if both window name and title are null
    in OperaDriver.window().  (stuartk)

  * Fix for a better way to verify whether EcmascriptService is
    available.  (stuartk)

  * Catch invalid runtime exception for EcmascriptService.  (stuartk)

  * Now logging which status we receive from the launcher.  (andreastt)

  * Doing all port guessing in OperaRunnerSettings since it's specific
    to launching Opera.  (andreastt)

  * Making sure Capabilities and OperaRunnerSettings are synchronized on
    launch.  (andreastt)

  * Logging for when launcher is copied was misplaced, now corrected to
    reflect reality.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Added tests for VersionUtils comparison.  (dturkoglu)

  * Removed irrelevant tests, corrected misleading pass conditions.
    (andreastt, stuartk)

  * Logging level when running tests is now set to FINE.  (stuartK)

  * Assert.assert* calls have now been replaced by static imports for
    JUnit tests.  (ajay, andreastt)

  * Added tests for all new code added in this version.  (andreastt)

  * Added method for setting the launcher manually to
    OperaLauncherRunnerSettings.  This should never be used for other
    purposes than testing.  (andreastt)

  * Added new @Ignore annotation which lets you ignore a test based on
    product and/or platform.  (andreastt)

  * Corrected ignores for core- and desktop-specific tests.  (andreastt)

  * Reworked tests to use OperaDriverTestCase as a base.  (andreastt)

  * Added tests for OperaColor.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Added descriptions for all packages.  (stuartk)

  * A lot of documentation added to various places.  (stuartk,
    andreastt)

  * Fixes for documentation in OperaDesktopDriver.  (andreastt)

  * Added IntelliJ run configurations for various tests.  (andreastt)

  * Removed reference to pkg/ as a library in IntelliJ configuration.
    (andreastt)

  * Examples have been cleaned up.  (andreastt)

  * Update Selenium JAR to 2.6.0.  (Ajay Kemparaj)

  * Update the protobuf library from 2.3.0 to 2.4.1 and regenerating all
    Proto files.  (stuartk)

  * If OPERA_PATH or OPERA_LAUNCHER are set to invalid paths, we will now fail
    instead of attempting to recover by guessing Opera's path.  (andreastt)

  * Add support for OperaDriver.switchTo().frame(WebElement).  (stuartk)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix bug preventing switching to frames beneath the current one.  (stuartk)

  * Lowering error logging level for key errors.  (andreastt)

  * Update Selenium atoms to r13805.  (stuartk)

  * Add documentation for some internal methods.  (stuartk)

  * If running OperaDriver from the source directory it will now find the
    launcher in the launcher/ directory.  (andreastt)

  * Update OperaWebElement.saveScreenshot() to use FileChannels.  (Ajay Kemparaj)


v0.7.2    2011-09-08

  [API CHANGES]

  * DefaultDriverFactory in Selenium expects a Capabilities type constructor
    argument rather than DesiredCapabilities.  OperaDriver now uses Capabilities
    instead to match the other WebDriver implementations.  This fixes various
    problems related to remote driving.  (andreastt)

  * The capability "opera.binary_profile" has been renamed to "opera.product".
    (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix OperaWebElement.getLocation for SVG documents.  (stuartk)

  * -autotestmode, -debugproxy and -pd arguments are now sent to Opera before
    unwrapping the arbitrary list of arguments sent by user.  (andreastt)

  * Sanitizing capabilities sent across the wire, as Ruby will sent us Long's
    for Integer's which are not easily converted in Java.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Correct checking for Windows platform in tests.  (stuartk)

  * Updated various tests.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Remove OperaDriver.convertByToAtom() as the WebDriver atoms now support
    getting locators by nice wire strings.  (andreastt)

  * Remove OperaDriver.getProduct(), .getOS(), .getBinaryPath(),
    .getCoreVersion(), .getUserAgent() and .getPID() and replace with
    OperaDriver.utils().*  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Make OperaWebElement.sendKeys enter text at the end when an input has
    default text.  (stuartk)

  * Clear Should only clear editable and enabled elements.  (ajayk)

  * Call services.shutdown(), as .quit() will also shut down Opera even if
    'opera.no_quit' is set to true.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Add backwards-compat support for Window Manager 2.0 (for Opera Mobile).
    (stuartk)

  [OTHER]

  * Remove OperaDriver.mouseEvent() method. Use the advanced interaction API
    instead. Update OperaExec to allow several mouse keys to be pressed at once.
    (andreastt)

  * Updated SocketMonitor to not be a singleton, so that connections to
    multiple instances of Opera can be maintained.  (stuartk)

  * Renamed OperaPaths.getOperaLauncherPath() to extractLauncher(path) to better match
    what the method is actually doing.  (andreastt)

  * Remove OperaDriver.shutdown().  (stuartk)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Support DesiredCapabilities. Capabilities include "opera.binary" and
    "opera.arguments" amongst others. See the top of the OperaDriver class
    for all of them.  (stuartk)

  * Support the "personal directory", `-pd`, flag with the "opera.profile"
    capability. Currently only available on Linux Opera builds.

  * Add "opera.port" capability to set the port that Opera communicates with
    driver on. Allows multiple instances of Opera to be run at once. Requires
    the `-debugproxy` flag, which is not yet available in current versions
    of Opera.  (stuartk)

  * Add capability to set the logging level and file with "opera.logging.level"
    and "opera.logging.file".  (andreastt)

  * Updated Linux launcher to support the `-profile` argument, to specify
    which build profile we are using (Note: this ISN'T the Opera user profile).
    (Iaroslav Tymchenko)

  * Display the command used to start Opera when it exits immediately (usually
    due to bad command line arguments).  (stuartk)

  [BUG FIXES]

    option (Karianne Ekern)

  * Wait between two double clicks so that Opera doesn't interpret it as as a
    quadruple-click.  (andreastt)

  * Throw InvalidSelectorException when selectors are invalid.  (stuartk)

  * Use OpenURL command in new Window Manager service. Fixes case where loading
    a page in a new window would cause a ResponseNotReceivedException.  (stuartk)

  * Don't timeout when a window is closed by Javascript.  (stuartk)

  * Check services isn't null before shutting it down.  (stuartk)

  [TESTS]

  * Add tests for modifier keys.  (stuartk)

  * Ignore some launcher tests on Windows.  (stuartk)

  * Update Selenium jar to 2.3.0.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added ability to navigate menus in Opera Desktop.  (Karianne Ekern,
    Adam Minchinton)

  * Add selftest service.  (Arne Skjærholt)

  * Use atoms from the Selenium project instead of our own custom JS for:

    - Finding elements from OperaDriver and OperaWebElement

    - Submitting and toggling OperaWebElement
    - Getting the text of OperaWebElement

    (stuartk)

  * If available show Ecmascript error message in the exception.  (stuartk)

  * Correctly return WebElements when they are in another JS object, such as

v0.4.2.pre5    2011-03-14

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed preference paths from OperaDriverSettings.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * New settings added to OperaDriverSettings:

    - Disable Opera Idle
    - Autostart setting to replace passing `null` into OperaDriver().

  * Always pass `-autotestmode` in to Opera. This will cause versions of Opera
    which do not support this flag to fail to start. Use a manual start instead.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Increase page load timeout from 5 seconds to 60 seconds.

  * Merged desktop changes.

  * Disallow deletion of default main user profile.

  * Do not use pageload timeout for window events

  * Reduce level of Opera Idle logging output.

  * Correctly re-extract launchers when they have changed inside the JAR.

  * Buildfile updated to make testing and releasing easier.

    - Version number is obtained from `git describe`.
    - `test` target generates reports.
    - Individual tests can be run using -Dclass=com.opera.core.systems.<Class>
     where <Class> is one of the classes under test/.
    - Add launchers to jar in `jar` task, rather than executing `zip`.
     Compatibility with Windows.

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Update launchers to die after losing their connection to OperaDriver. Fix
    for launchers on Windows lingering.

  * Fixes for some "No response in a timely fashion" exceptions.  Prevent
    buffer under-runs on slow connections.

  [TESTS]

  * Added and updated unit tests for:

    - Frames
    - OperaDriver core
    - OperaLauncherRunner
    - Opera path guessing
    - Opera Idle
