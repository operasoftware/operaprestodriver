  * The capabilities for Opera now accepts an OperaProfile object for
    "opera.profile".  (andreastt)

  * The capabilities for Opera now accepts a Level object for
    "opera.logging.level".  (andreastt)

  * OperaIntervals.ENABLE_DEBUGGER has been moved to

    (ajaykv)


  [NEW FEATURES]

  * New interface OperaProfile for interacting with the profile for
    Opera.  You can for example modify or set new preferences on
    profile before Opera is started:

       OperaProfile profile = new OperaProfile();  // fresh profile
       profile.preferences().set("User Prefs",
                                 "Ignore Unrequested Popups", false);
       WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver(profile);

    You can also interact with existing profiles by passing in the
    directory to OperaProfile's constructor.

    (andreastt)

  * New interface OperaPreferences for managing preferences in
    preference files (like operaprefs.ini) and during runtime through
    Scope.

    Calls to preference may be done like this:

       driver.preferences().set("User Prefs",
                                "Ignore Unrequested Popups", false);

    OperaScopePreferences replaces OperaDriver.getPref() and
    OperaDriver.setPref() which are now deprecated.

    (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Reduced much code duplication.  (andreastt)

  * Default product for OperaRunnerSettings is now DESKTOP.
    (andreastt)

  * Upgraded WebDriver atoms.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded OperaWebElement.click() to use new atoms for selecting an
    OPTION element.  (andreastt)

  * Check for whether launcher exists immediately.  (andreastt)


  [BUG FIXES]

  * Asserting if element is stale on OperaWebElement.getText(),
    getLocation(), getTagName() and clear().  (andreastt)

  * If a page load times out we now return control of the browser _in
    all_ situations.  (andreastt)

  * Reverted check for setLastModified on newly copied launcher as it
    seems to be failing on Windows.  (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherRunner.isOperaRunning() no longer throws exception if
    launcher has shut down, but returns false instead.  (andreastt)

  * Object IDs are being garbage collected on each new page load, no
    need to store and verify URL when checking for stale elements.
    (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherBinary is now using Platform.is() (from Selenium) for
    platform comparison.  Will output nicer warning when failing on
    Windows without VS C++ 2008 redistributable package.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed issue with SocketException for double shutdown call in
    OperaLauncherRunnerProtocol, fixes tests for Windows.  (andreastt)

  * Getting colours with non-RGB values (such as "transparent") now
    works.  Resolves issue #49.  (andreastt)

  * OperaDriver.close() should quit browser if it closes the last
    window, resolves issue #48.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Added many new test run configurations for IntelliJ.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed NullPointerException in the case something went wrong during
    initialization of OperaDriver in OperaDriverTestCase.  (andreastt)

  * Added tests for OperaStrings.  (ajayk)

  * Tests for circumstances where StaleElementReferenceException
    should be thrown.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored many tests so that they pass on Windows, where JUnit
    test order is not guaranteed.  (andreastt)

  * Tests for handing back control to user after reaching
    PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Documented many methods.  (andreastt)

  * Updated Eclipse configuration.  (ajayk)

  * Updated IntelliJ configuration for version 11.  (andreastt)

  * Compile target “compile_tests” now requires “jar”.  (andreastt)

  * Added more examples to the README.  (andreastt)

  * Removed old interactions implementation in
    com.opera.core.systems.interaction since it was never used.
    (andreastt)


v0.8.1    2011-11-24

  [API CHANGES]

  * OperaDriver.get() and OperaNavigation().to() now catches
    ResponseNotReceivedException so that when a page load times out on
    very slow-loading pages, the control of the browser instance to the
    user.  (andreastt)

  * Added method pageLoadTimeout() to OperaTimeouts which allows you to
    control the default page load timeout, that is the timeout for when
    control of the browser should be handed back to the user.  Example:

      driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(40, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

    (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Output from Opera and the launcher is now forwarded to the
    appropriate logging level in OperaDriver.  (andreastt, danielb)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Upgraded Selenium dependency to 2.13.0.  (andreastt)

  * Upgraded WebDriver atoms to match Selenium 2.13.0.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored heuristic for figuring out a sensible logging level
    between OperaDriver and launcher.  (andreastt)

  * Refactored OperaPaths.operaPath() to look for Opera Next binaries on
    all platforms.  Resolves OPDRV-104.  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Ensuring that the launcher is executable on each run.  (andreastt)

  * Fixed bug with synchronized locks ought to be on fields classified
    as final in WaitState.  (andreastt)

  * OperaArguments does not parse OPERA_ARGS, so calling
    OperaCoreArguments on startup instead.  Fixes bug with OPERA_ARGS
    not being parsed.  Addresses OPDRV-108.  (andreastt)

  * Parsing a single argument failed due to a bug in regex, corrected.
    Addresses OPDRV-108.  (andreastt)

  * Removed superflous call to isPathValid() in OperaPaths when checking
    whether a specified/set path is invalid.  (andreastt)

  * Arguments added in OperaCoreArgument's constructor were not merged
    if OperaRunner received an OperaRunnerSettings object with the
    arguments field set.  (andreastt)

  * Actions sent to OperaDriver.operaAction() are now converted to lower
    case in OperaExec.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Removed superflous code in OperaLauncherRunnerTest, and made
    assertions static.  (andreastt)

  * Added deprecated OperaDriverSettings tests to a separate file.
    (andreastt)

  * Added test for single argument parsing to OperaArgumentsTest.
    (andreastt)

  * Added new run configuration for OperaLauncherRunnerTest and
    OperaRunnerTest.  (andreastt)

  * Added tsts for OperaLauncherRunner.toLauncherLoggingLevel().
    (andreastt)

  * The "File Types Section Info" section does not exist on core-tv,
    using "Disk Cache" instead for PrefsTest, resolves about five
    failing tests on this configuration.  (andreastt)

  * Moved context menu test to be run last in ElementsTest because it's
    known to cause problems for consecutive tests.  (andreastt)

  * OperaRunnerTest now uses a mocking OperaRunner instance,
    TestOperaRunner, which exposes the settings field through a getter.
    (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Fixed classpath issues with previous release.  (ajayk)

  * Added Apache Commons Exec 1.1 as dependency as
    org.openqa.selenium.os.CommandLine now depends on it.  (andreastt)

  * Explanation for IllegalArgumentException for
    OperaExec.mouseAction(), helps WTR-362.  (andreastt)


v0.8    2011-11-17

  [API CHANGES]

  * OperaDriver now uses temporary profile and random port by default.
    This breaks backwards-compatibility with Opera < 11.60.  Please set
    capabilities opera.profile to "" (empty string) and opera.port to -1
    for it to not use a temporary profile and the default port (7001).
    (stuartk)

  * Updated Selenium dependency to 2.12.0.  (andreastt)

  * Throwing UnsupportedCommandException rather than a
    WebDriverException in OperaExec, so that it can be recovered.
    (andreastt)

  * Throwing UnsupportedOperationException for Options.ime().
    (andreastt)

  * Added Options.window() as a beta feature.  Currently not
    implemented, and will throw UnsupportedOperationException.
    (andreastt)

  * OperaRunnerSettings.setProduct() now accepts an OperaProduct, and
    not a String anymore.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * EcmascriptService is now used by default in OperaDriver, instead of
    EcmaScriptDebugger.  This means any injected JavaScript now
    potentially goes through JIT, enabling the JIT compiler inside the
    browser.  (stuartk)

  * Added "compile_protos" target to Ant build file for compiling proto
    files to Java classes.  (stuartk)

  * Added support for frame switching.  (stuartk)

  * Introducing OperaArguments (with accompanying OperaArgument,
    OperaCoreArgument and OperaDesktopArgument) which defines a joint
    interface for interacting with arguments to various kinds of Opera
    products.  (andreastt)

  * OperaProduct keeps a list of all Opera products.  (andreastt)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Update EcmascriptService to be more similar to EcmaScriptDebugger.
    (stuartk)

  * Abstracted RuntimeNode from EcmaScriptDebugger into its own class so
    that it can be reused in EcmascriptService.  (stuartk)

  * Move methods common to EcmaScriptDebugger and EcmascriptService to a
    new class, AbstractEcmascriptService.

  * Replacing Apache Commons IO library calls with Guava (Simon Stewart,
    andreastt)

  * Upgraded from using OperaDriverSettings to using DesiredCapabilities
    in OperaDesktopDriver.  (andreastt)

  * The launchers have now been moved to a separate JAR,
    operalaunchers-*.jar, effectively removing the need to traverse the
    repo when running from source in SpartanRunner.  (andreastt)

  * OperaLauncherRunner made separate from OperaRunner.  OperaRunner now
    implements a Java native way of launching Opera.  (andreastt)

  * Logging all ES implementations used to FINE rather than INFO.
    (andreastt)

  * Which Opera product is used is fetched after connecting and stored
    in the capability "opera.product".  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * OperaWebElement.getCssValue() now returns HEX values for
    colour-related variables.  (andreastt)

  * We were setting OperaIntervals#WAIT_FOR_ELEMENT to 0 every time when
    looking for an element, which overrode the implicit wait time
    specified through driver.manage().timeouts().  (andreastt)

  * Use the passed idle argument, not forcing idle to be true when
    calling setUseOperaIdle().  (danielb)

  * Since -pd is ignored by core builds, we must for some reason send
    -autotestmode last so that it doesn't consider the temporary profile
    to be the starting URL.  (andreastt)

  * Fix for making sure we create runtimes when we try to find them,
    instead of when we try to update the runtimes in EcmascriptService.
    (stuartk)

  * getWindowHandles() now gives names to windows without names.
    (stuartk)

  * Fix for NullPointerException if both window name and title are null
    in OperaDriver.window().  (stuartk)

  * Fix for a better way to verify whether EcmascriptService is
    available.  (stuartk)

  * Catch invalid runtime exception for EcmascriptService.  (stuartk)

  * Now logging which status we receive from the launcher.  (andreastt)

  * Doing all port guessing in OperaRunnerSettings since it's specific
    to launching Opera.  (andreastt)

  * Making sure Capabilities and OperaRunnerSettings are synchronized on
    launch.  (andreastt)

  * Logging for when launcher is copied was misplaced, now corrected to
    reflect reality.  (andreastt)
  
  [TESTS]

  * Added tests for VersionUtils comparison.  (dturkoglu)

  * Removed irrelevant tests, corrected misleading pass conditions.
    (andreastt, stuartk)

  * Logging level when running tests is now set to FINE.  (stuartK)

  * Assert.assert* calls have now been replaced by static imports for
    JUnit tests.  (ajay, andreastt)

  * Added tests for all new code added in this version.  (andreastt)

  * Added method for setting the launcher manually to
    OperaLauncherRunnerSettings.  This should never be used for other
    purposes than testing.  (andreastt)

  * Added new @Ignore annotation which lets you ignore a test based on
    product and/or platform.  (andreastt)

  * Corrected ignores for core- and desktop-specific tests.  (andreastt)

  * Reworked tests to use OperaDriverTestCase as a base.  (andreastt)

  * Added tests for OperaColor.  (andreastt)

  [OTHER]

  * Added descriptions for all packages.  (stuartk)

  * A lot of documentation added to various places.  (stuartk,
    andreastt)

  * Fixes for documentation in OperaDesktopDriver.  (andreastt)

  * Added IntelliJ run configurations for various tests.  (andreastt)

  * Removed reference to pkg/ as a library in IntelliJ configuration.
    (andreastt)

  * Examples have been cleaned up.  (andreastt)

    instead of attempting to recover by guessing Opera's path.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Add support for OperaDriver.switchTo().frame(WebElement).  (stuartk)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix bug preventing switching to frames beneath the current one.  (stuartk)

    launcher in the launcher/ directory.  (andreastt)

  * Update OperaWebElement.saveScreenshot() to use FileChannels.  (Ajay Kemparaj)


v0.7.2    2011-09-08

  [API CHANGES]

  * DefaultDriverFactory in Selenium expects a Capabilities type constructor
    argument rather than DesiredCapabilities.  OperaDriver now uses Capabilities
    instead to match the other WebDriver implementations.  This fixes various
    problems related to remote driving.  (andreastt)

  * The capability "opera.binary_profile" has been renamed to "opera.product".
    (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Fix OperaWebElement.getLocation for SVG documents.  (stuartk)

  * -autotestmode, -debugproxy and -pd arguments are now sent to Opera before
    unwrapping the arbitrary list of arguments sent by user.  (andreastt)

  * Sanitizing capabilities sent across the wire, as Ruby will sent us Long's
    for Integer's which are not easily converted in Java.  (andreastt)

  [TESTS]

  * Correct checking for Windows platform in tests.  (stuartk)

  * Updated various tests.  (andreastt)

  * Remove OperaDriver.convertByToAtom() as the WebDriver atoms now support
    getting locators by nice wire strings.  (andreastt)

  * Remove OperaDriver.getProduct(), .getOS(), .getBinaryPath(),
    .getCoreVersion(), .getUserAgent() and .getPID() and replace with
    OperaDriver.utils().*  (andreastt)

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Make OperaWebElement.sendKeys enter text at the end when an input has
    default text.  (stuartk)

  * Clear Should only clear editable and enabled elements.  (ajayk)

  * Call services.shutdown(), as .quit() will also shut down Opera even if
    'opera.no_quit' is set to true.  (andreastt)

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Add backwards-compat support for Window Manager 2.0 (for Opera Mobile).
    (stuartk)

  [OTHER]

  * Remove OperaDriver.mouseEvent() method. Use the advanced interaction API
    instead. Update OperaExec to allow several mouse keys to be pressed at once.
    (andreastt)

  * Updated SocketMonitor to not be a singleton, so that connections to
    multiple instances of Opera can be maintained.  (stuartk)

  * Renamed OperaPaths.getOperaLauncherPath() to extractLauncher(path) to better match
    what the method is actually doing.  (andreastt)

  * Remove OperaDriver.shutdown().  (stuartk)
 
  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Support DesiredCapabilities. Capabilities include "opera.binary" and
    "opera.arguments" amongst others. See the top of the OperaDriver class
    for all of them.  (stuartk)

  * Support the "personal directory", `-pd`, flag with the "opera.profile"
    capability. Currently only available on Linux Opera builds.

  * Add "opera.port" capability to set the port that Opera communicates with
    driver on. Allows multiple instances of Opera to be run at once. Requires
    the `-debugproxy` flag, which is not yet available in current versions
    of Opera.  (stuartk)

  * Add capability to set the logging level and file with "opera.logging.level"
    and "opera.logging.file".  (andreastt)

  * Updated Linux launcher to support the `-profile` argument, to specify
    which build profile we are using (Note: this ISN'T the Opera user profile).
    (Iaroslav Tymchenko)

  * Display the command used to start Opera when it exits immediately (usually
    due to bad command line arguments).  (stuartk)

    quadruple-click.  (andreastt)

  * Throw InvalidSelectorException when selectors are invalid.  (stuartk)

  * Use OpenURL command in new Window Manager service. Fixes case where loading
    a page in a new window would cause a ResponseNotReceivedException.  (stuartk)

  * Don't timeout when a window is closed by Javascript.  (stuartk)

  * Check services isn't null before shutting it down.  (stuartk)
 
  [TESTS]

  * Update Selenium jar to 2.3.0.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * Added ability to navigate menus in Opera Desktop.  (Karianne Ekern,
    Adam Minchinton)

  * Add selftest service.  (Arne Skjærholt)

  * Use atoms from the Selenium project instead of our own custom JS for:

    - Finding elements from OperaDriver and OperaWebElement
    - Getting attributes, style, location and size of OperaWebElement
    - Getting displayed, enabled and selected state of OperaWebElement
    - Submitting and toggling OperaWebElement
    - Getting the text of OperaWebElement

    (stuartk)

  * If available show Ecmascript error message in the exception.  (stuartk)

  * Correctly return WebElements when they are in another JS object, such as

    (stuartk)

  * Shutdown Scope services in alternate way to support earlier Opera versions.
    (stuartk)


v0.5    2011-06-26

  [API CHANGES]

  * Removed preference paths from OperaDriverSettings.

  [NEW FEATURES]

  * New settings added to OperaDriverSettings:

    - Disable Opera Idle
    - Autostart setting to replace passing `null` into OperaDriver().

    - Version number is obtained from `git describe`.
    - `test` target generates reports.
    - Individual tests can be run using -Dclass=com.opera.core.systems.<Class>
     where <Class> is one of the classes under test/.
    - Add launchers to jar in `jar` task, rather than executing `zip`.
     Compatibility with Windows.
